# README

Please read this

- There are 2 fonts(Inter and Poppins) specified in the figma design and they have already been imported in the `index.html` file. To use a specific font (for example `Inter`), you can just declare the font-family in your css file like so:

```css
    font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
```

- Images you may need is inside the `public/src/assets` folder

- I have added a package: `react-icons` that you can use for icons. This is the documentation [react icons documentation](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons)
